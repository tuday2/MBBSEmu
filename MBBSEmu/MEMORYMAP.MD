# MBBSEmu Memory Map
Each Module in MBBSEmu is provided a dedicated, full 16-bit address space. Meaning each module is capable of addressing up to 4GB of Memory per module.

On a tradidional 16-bit system, there are a maximum of 65,535 (0xFFFF) memory segments containing 65,535 (0xFFFF). Modern Operating Sytems handle memory management,
moving data for multiple programs between segments and allocating the memory a program needs. Because MBBSEmu is running in a virtual environment, modules do not need to
share their memory space with other modules running on the same system.

Additionally, memory in MBBSEmu is only allocated when it's needed. Meaning while two modules have 8GB of total memory available to them (4GB * 2), the total memory used by MBBSEmu
might be as low as 100MB as that's all that was required by the modules to operate.

This markdown file is to map how the memory is allocated within MBBSEmu.

## Active Memory Map
Addresses in the Active Memory Map can be accessed and manipulated during program operation as they represent underlying data the given address

|Start|End|Size|Definition|
|--|--|--|--|
|0x0000:0x0000|0x0000:0xFFFF|65KB|CPU Stack|
|0x0001:0x0000|0x0FFF:0xFFFF|~256MB|Code/Data Segments|
|0x1000:0x0000|0x1FFF:0xFFFF|256MB|Variable Data|
|0x2000:0x0000|0x2FFF:0xFFFF|256MB|Real Mode Data|

|0x4000:0x0000|0x4000:0xFFFF|65K|PSP Memory Segment for INT 21h Calls (Modules)|

## Virtual Memory Map
Virtual Memory Addresses are used to denote a translation to another function within MBBSEmu.

### Exported Ordinals
During relocation, records in the Imported Name Table are replaced with Segments that correspond to their Imported Function. These functions (Exported by MajorBBS/Worldgroup), provide additional functionality for Modules compiled against the SDK.

**Segment 0xFFFF** - Corresponds to the Exported Module **MAJORBBS**, where the offset of the address corresponds to the ordinal of the function/property being used.

**Segment 0xFFFE** - Corresponds to the Exported Module **GALGSBL**, where the offset of the address corresponds to the ordinal of the function/property being used.

**Segment 0xFFFD** - Corresponds to the Exported Module **PHAPI**, where the offset of the address corresponds to the ordinal of the function/property being used.

**Segment 0xFFFC** - Corresponds to the Exported Module **GALME**, where the offset of the address corresponds to the ordinal of the function/property being used.

**Segment 0xFFFB** - Corresponds to the Exported Module **DOSCALLS**, where the offset of the address corresponds to the ordinal of the function/property being used.

**Segment 0xFFFA** - Corresponds to the Exported Module **GALMSG**, where the offset of the address corresponds to the ordinal of the function/property being used.
